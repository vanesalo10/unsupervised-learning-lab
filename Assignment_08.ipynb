    "There are several strategies that can be employed to make PCA more robust. Here are some of them:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scaling the data: PCA is sensitive to the scale of the data, so scaling the data to have zero mean and unit variance can help make it more robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handling outliers: Outliers can have a significant impact on PCA results. Therefore, it is important to identify and handle outliers appropriately. One way to do this is to remove outliers from the dataset or to use robust PCA methods that are less sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using a different covariance matrix estimator: PCA is based on the covariance matrix of the data. However, the sample covariance matrix can be unstable, especially in high dimensions. To address this issue, alternative covariance matrix estimators can be used, such as the shrinkage estimator, which can lead to more robust results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cross-validation: Cross-validation can help evaluate the robustness of PCA results. By repeating PCA with different subsets of the data, it is possible to identify which components are stable and which ones are not.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regularization: Regularization can be used to reduce overfitting and improve the robustness of PCA results. Regularized PCA methods, such as sparse PCA or low-rank PCA, can help identify more robust components that are less influenced by noise in the data."
